# React-Books-App ðŸ“š

 <br>



#### This is a book application. We see the information of the books in the project through the API. We can add these books to our favorites, and remove them from favorites. When you click on the book image, we get detailed information about the book. This project was completed using CSS, Tailwind and React.js, and my purpose in making this project was to experience the basic React-Router-Dom and Context API features. The project was made as a responsive design.<br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- CSS
- Tailwind
- React hooks
- Regular Expression
- Responsive Design
- Context API
- React Router DOM
